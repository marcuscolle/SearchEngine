# SearchEngine

SearchEngine mini project was a tdd idea based project focused on the backend rather then frontend side.

.env file must be added to the project

As im using vite.js to compile the project and ive ran the production commmand npm run build it should work fine on frontend perspective. in case there's errors or not displaying anything its a simple npm intall, npm run dev / npm run build commands.
